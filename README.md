Best practices shouldn't be followed blindly. 

We can learn about best practices either from a mentor through his past experience or we can learn from our own experience (usually with costly consequences). When we start learning to code our mentors will warn us about certain practices that have the potential to break our code and that's fine, we can learn from their experience without paying any immediate cost. The downside is that we can potentially follow their instructions blindly.

But I think there's a third way, we can code "bad practices" in a safe environment, far from any production code. This respository was created to give myself some exposure to some common bad practices, so I can learn with real code and not only by reading the theory.
